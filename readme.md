This is a React learning project from the Udemy React course with Max Schwarzmueller.

While a link to the full solution is given at the end of the course, I followed every module and did the entire code-along.

This purpose of this project was to learn how to configure webpack from scratch. This React app runs development start and production build scripts without having used create-react-app.
